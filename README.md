CVE-2024-47176 Scanner
===

Evilsocket's PoC for CVE-2024-47176, trimmed and turned into a scanner. I literally opened it in vim and held down the d key.

Read his research [here](https://www.evilsocket.net/2024/09/26/Attacking-UNIX-systems-via-CUPS-Part-I/). This script just sends the initial UDP packet to port 631 and triggers an http callback, signalling a vulnerable host.

Usage:
```
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/tonyarris/CVE-2024-47176-Scanner && cd CVE-2024-47176-Scanner/

# set up a virtualenv
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate

# install ippserver
pip3 install ippserver

# set up an http listener, e.g. on app.interactsh.com or with Burp Collaborator

# prepare an input list of IPv4 addresses, one per line

# run
python3 scan.py your.callback-server.com input-list.txt
```
See your results on your callback server:
